# Modelação e Simulação 2022/2023

This repository contains the lab materials and notes for the **Modelação e Simulação** course at Instituto Superior Técnico, University of Lisbon. The documents are organized into the following folders:

- `Lab1`: Logistic equation, Pharmacodynamics and Pharmakinetics in tumor growth, Euler's integration
- `Lab2`: Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods
- `Lab3`: Hybrid System analysis
- `Notes`: The notes are organized by topic and correspond to the course materials covered in class.

The labs cover a wide range of topics, including Monte Carlo simulations, time series analysis, stochastic processes, optimization and agent-based modeling. Each lab includes MATLAB™ scripts and LaTeX reports that explain the theory behind each topic aswell as the simulation methodology and results.

In addition to the labs, the repository also contains lecture notes, and additional resources for the course. 

These materials provide a comprehensive overview of simulations and modeling, with a focus on practical applications and real-world examples.
